# CD4500-TouchScreen

For input path navigation you can't use keyboard arrow or mouse.
But CTRL + A is still available.

Do not press enter or any other command in this input.

Multiple touch is supported but only for 2 finger max !

If want to simulate multiple touch, you need to do it first. If you do not the soft will need a restart.
